# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve **celery-plus**.

If you’re planning a non-trivial change (API behavior, defaults, or compatibility), please open an issue first so we can align on approach.

## Development setup

- Install dependencies: `npm ci`
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Build TypeScript: `npm run dist`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Format:
  - Apply formatting: `npm run format`
  - Check formatting (CI-friendly): `npm run format-check`

If you hit ESM-related Mocha/ts-node errors (e.g. `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`) locally, you can try:

`node --loader ts-node/esm --experimental-specifier-resolution=node ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha.js "./test/**/*"`

Notes:

- This package is **ESM** (`"type": "module"`). Please keep imports/exports ESM-compatible.
- `dist/` is generated by `npm run dist` and is ignored by git (do not commit it).
- `prepublishOnly` runs `npm run dist` and `npm test`.

## Contribution guidelines

- Keep changes small and focused; avoid drive-by refactors.
- Prefer **async/await** over `.then()` chains.
- Preserve existing public APIs unless the change is explicitly discussed.
- Update docs when behavior changes (defaults, supported URL schemes, or error handling).

## Broker/backend URL schemes (gotchas)

celery-plus supports multiple broker/backend URL schemes:

- Broker: `amqp://`, `amqps://`, `redis://`, `rediss://`
- Backend: `disabled://`, `rpc://`, `rpcs://`, `amqp://`, `amqps://`, `redis://`, `rediss://`

Important behavior:

- The backend is optional. If omitted, celery-plus uses `disabled://` (fire-and-forget; no result tracking).
- To use `AsyncResult`, provide an explicit backend (e.g. `rpc://...` for AMQP-based results, or `redis://...`).

RabbitMQ vhosts:

- Always include the vhost in your AMQP URL when you’re not using `/`.
  Example: `amqp://user:pass@host:5672/dev`
- If you see errors like `vhost / not found`, your URL likely points to the wrong vhost (or a default URL was used).

## Pull request checklist

- `npm test`
- `npm run dist`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format-check`
- Docs updated (README/examples) if you changed:
  - default behavior (e.g. backend defaults)
  - supported schemes (`disabled://`, `rpc://`, etc.)
  - connection/url handling (RabbitMQ vhost expectations)

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project maintainer at emunshi.studio@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
